Running Spring Batch Admin

  Hints for custom applications:
  
    * Look at the sample.
    
    * Create a war project with an index.jsp and a web.xml (from the sample or from 
    the <<<spring-batch-admin-resources.jar>>>).
    
    * Include the <<<spring-batch-admin-*.jar>>> files in <<<WEB-INF/lib>>>.  In the sample this is done simply by 
    making the WAR depend on those jar files in the Maven pom.
    
    * Deploy the web app.
